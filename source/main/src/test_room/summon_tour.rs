//! gauge [tour setup]. Sora attacks (Attack, the top row) so that the
//! summons that answer Sora's attacks (Peter Pan, Genie) have something to
//! answer; Genie's first form is picked from the second deck's row 2; then
//! the second deck's Limit row, which the summon's script offers its limit
//! on, starts the summon's limit and the reaction button takes its
//! follow-ups. The first three summons are dismissed, the last runs out of
