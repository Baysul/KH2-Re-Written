//! Enemy and boss behavior driven by the object scripts of the installed game.
//!
//! The scripts (BAR type 3 entries of `obj/*.mdlx`) are loaded from the user's
//! install at runtime; nothing here contains game data. `script` is the script
//! interpreter translated from the executable; the rest of the crate supplies
//! the engine services the scripts call.
